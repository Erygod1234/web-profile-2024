      I want to practice writing font ends and back ends in order to become a full stack in the future.
      I love programming. So I have the encouragement to write various code.I am introvert but I talk a lot 
      with people I'm close to or have similar activities so I can have something to talk about. I'm a kind 
      person and I tend to care about the feelings of the people around me.
